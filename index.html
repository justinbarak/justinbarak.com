      <p class="bio">
        I spend my days optimizing refinery operations and my evenings tinkering with code.
        Chemical engineer by training, self-taught Python developer by curiosity — turns out
        the same instinct that finds the efficient path through a distillation column works
        pretty well on a stubborn API too.

        <p class="section-body">
          Twelve years as a Refinery Optimization Engineer. Before that, a chemical engineering
          degree — summa cum laude, which I mention only because my kids think it's funny that
          their dad went to school for so long to learn how to boil things.
        </p>
        <p class="section-body">
          The job is essentially applied math at industrial scale: find the most profitable
          way to run a complex system constrained by thermodynamics, market prices, equipment
          limits, and regulatory requirements — all simultaneously, in real time. It's a
          good problem. I've been at it for over a decade and it still surprises me.
        </p>
        <p class="section-body">
          I picked up Python during COVID when I got tired of waiting for someone else to
          build the tools I needed. Turns out the optimization mindset translates. Whether
          it's a refinery process or a data pipeline, the question is the same: where's
          the bottleneck, and what's the cheapest way to remove it?

              Built an RFID-triggered music player for my kids using a Raspberry Pi.
              Tap a card, play an album. Simple enough that a four-year-old can run it;
              complicated enough that it took way longer than expected.
